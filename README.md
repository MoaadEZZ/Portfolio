# 🎭 Persona-Style Portfolio - Moaad Ezzahir

> I'm a nerd who likes Persona and decided to make my portfolio like this on a whim.

An interactive **Persona 5 Royal-inspired portfolio** built from scratch with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** using a lightweight **Model-View-Controller architecture**.

It combines my interests in **Web Development & UI/UX Design** with my obsession with **Persona's Stylish UI**.

- **Dynamic Content** - Fetches GitHub repositories, stars, and languages through the GitHub API.
- **Immersive Design** - Custom cursor, sound effects, video backgrounds, and animated transitions.
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Navigate using `↑` `↓`, `Enter`, and `Esc`.
- **Responsive Layout** - Designed to work across different screen sizes.

- HTML5
- CSS3
